Welcome to the **Efficient Deep Learning and Embodiment Group** at [MMLab](https://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/).

Our group focuses on developing efficient deep learning methods and their applications in embodied AI systems. We aim to bridge the gap between powerful deep learning models and real-world deployment on resource-constrained platforms, including robots and edge devices.

Our research spans several key areas:
- **Efficient Deep Learning**: model compression, neural architecture search, knowledge distillation, and efficient training strategies
- **Embodied AI**: vision-language-action models, robotic manipulation, navigation, and multi-modal reasoning for embodied agents
- **Foundation Models**: efficient adaptation and deployment of large-scale vision and language models

We are actively looking for self-motivated students and researchers to join our team. If you are interested, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:group@example.com).
